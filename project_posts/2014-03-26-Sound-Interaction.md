#Audio.

The audio for the installation is being develop using supercollider.


To achieve this I'm going to send OSC(open Sound Control) messages to the various applications. Also a library called MIDetectorOSC which sends musical information to other applications via OSC messages. This is very useful to allow perfect real-time synchronization between audio and video.
