#Audio.

The audio for the installation is being develop using supercollider.

To achieve audio-reactive visuals were going use a library that i'm current colaborating [MIDetectorOSC](https://github.com/beangoben/MIDetectorOSC), which sends musical information to other applications via OSC messages. This is very useful to allow perfect real-time synchronization between audio and video.
