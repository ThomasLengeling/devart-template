Manifold describes a continuos dynamic movement of a 2 dimensional euclidian geometry. The geometry is composed by various simple triangles that put together form a complex structure. Each vertex of the triangulation is in a constant motion because each vertex is part of a particle system, so forces like gravity, attraction and repulsion exists. But the color for earch vertex is obtain from a data mining process. Only with user interaction the piece comes to life.
