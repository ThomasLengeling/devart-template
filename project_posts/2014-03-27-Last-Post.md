A final test of the application on a multitouch display format.

The communication between the touch display and Cinder was done using TUIO protocol, it's fairly easy to make the integration of the TUIO protocol in a Cinder project.

The installation has the following four elements: visuals, audio, custom search engine and touch interaction.

Manifold describes a continuous dynamic movement of a 2 dimensional euclidian geometry. The geometry is composed by various simple triangles that put together form a complex structure. Each vertex of the triangulation is in a constant motion because each vertex is part of a particle system, so forces like gravity, attraction and repulsion exists. But the color of each vertex is obtained only from a data mining process. With user interaction the piece comes to life.

Manifold use a combination of 2D still images into a 3D rendering product. The final output is a canvas that includes calculating the Delaunay triangulation that is applied to a photographic still obtained from Google Custom Search. The image creates an abstract sculpt of a 2D mesh, which then is fed into a particle system. In particular, this method was employed for interacting multi-cellular systems in Biology and in engineering practices. The presented method allows the definition of a triangulation within a subset of particles attributed to a surface.
