Manifold describes a continuos dynamic movement of a 2 dimensional euclidian geometry. The geometry is composed by various simple triangles that put together form a complex structure. Each vertex of the triangulation is in a constant motion because each vertex is part of a particle system, so forces like gravity, attraction and repulsion exists. 

In the installation the audience are able to reconstruct o preserve the topology and the physics with hand gestures. TopologyÂ is concerned with properties of space and the continuous, dynamic relationships through which space is constituted. Transforming the topology of the mesh alters the representation of objects into different viewpoints. The output is unpredictable and changes according to the physics of the system. This is a way of making the relationship between real and digital visible.
