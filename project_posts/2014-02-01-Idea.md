Manifold describes a continuos dynamic movement of a 2 dimensional euclidian geometry. The geometry is composed by various simple triangles that put together form a complex structure. Each vertex of the triangulation is in a constant motion because each vertex is part of a particle system, so forces like gravity, attraction and repulsion exists. 

The idea is for the audience to be able to reconstruct o preserve the topology and the physics with hand gestures. TopologyÂ is concerned with properties of space and the continuous, dynamic relationships through which space is constituted. We want develop a composition where user interaction, audio, visuals and tecnology collide. 

With gesture recognition form a multitouch screen is possible to transform the topology of a mesh. Continueslly change the topology. This is a way of making the relationship between real and digital visible.

The idea of the installation is to have the following elements, generative visuals that are going to be made with cinder, audio with supercollider, data retrival with the Custom Search Engine from google and  multitouch screens for user interaction with the piece.
