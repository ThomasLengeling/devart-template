## Description

A series of studies in geometric symmetry, dynamic particles and interactivity on a large format multitouch screen. It explores techniques of manipulating a digital sculpt throughout the interaction of the users.The audience are able to alter the geometry and the physics to transform the representation of objects into different viewpoints. The source for the study are various Nebula images taken from the the Hubble Space Telescope. Those images are exposed into a abstract form which is possible to manipulate in real time with the touch of the users.
