## Description

A series of studies in geometric symmetry, dynamic particles and interactivity on a large format multitouch screen. It explores techniques of manipulating a digital sculpt throughout the interaction of the users.The audience are able to alter the geometry and the physics to transform the representation of objects into different viewpoints. The source for the study are various images taken from a automatic mining programm that extracts a set of images in a giving moment of time using the Custom Search API from Google. Some images are Nebulas from Hubble Space Telescope or even Picassos paintings. Those images are exposed into a abstract form which is possible to manipulate in real time with the touch of the users. This is a way of making the relationship between real and digital visible.

## Link to Prototype

Prototype of the initial project. The idea is to expand this current idea with real time data mining capability.
